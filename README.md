Goals:  

(i) Determine the key climatic drivers of flowering phenology for annual and perennial species. 

(ii) Compare the phenological sensitivity of plant species â€“ what about each species could result in their sensitivity and how does this vary spatially?    

(iii) Develop and assess predictive models for future phenological shifts.   

Q: Does phenological sensitivity differ between annual and perennial plant species, and how do their distinct life-history strategies influence these sensitivities across regions with varying climates?
